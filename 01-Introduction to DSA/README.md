## 01 Introduction to DSA

In today's world data became the most valuable asset to each and every organization. But just having huge data is not enough.
It is very important to convert that data into information and the information into insight. For this the data need to be
Arranged, stored and utilized in most efficient way possible. This is what DSA aim to do.

DSA (Data structure and algorithms) helps us to structure, store and retrieve data in most efficient way based on the specific
requirements. DSA consists of two different term which are 'Data structure' and 'Algorithms'. Let's understand these terms first.

### What is data structure?
**Data structures are different ways/structures to arrange and store data so that it can be used in most efficient way.** Consider
a kitchen in pizza shop, all toppings are stored in different individual container in a line so that based on order, chef
can quickly pick the required topping and make a pizza. Now consider same pizza shop kitchen but instead of storing the toppings
in a systematic way if all toppings are in a single container, then in such case chef will need to spend some time to find
required toppings before baking the pizza. So it is important to have a all toppings arranged in a systematic way. Same 
goes with data, if we have data stored in a structured way then finding necessary data is comparatively easy and less 
time consuming. 

### What is algorithm?
Consider in above pizza show someone ordered onion pizza. Then to make the onion pizza chef will have to first prepare pizza dough,
then he will have to spread that dough to create pizza base, then he will have to apply pizza sauce on top of it, then he will 
have to add cheese and onion topping then he must bake that pizza for some time at certain temperature. Only after following
all these steps the pizza will be ready. So this is kind of defined steps to make an onion pizza. Similarly, in computer science
we have to perform certain steps based on requirements to come to a meaningful conclusion based on data that we have. These steps 
are nothing but the algorithm to solve given problem or to satisfy given requirements. So we can define algorithm as.
**Algorithms are specific set of steps or instructions which need to be followed to solve given problem.** Now there can be 
more than one way (algorithms) to solve a problem. So good algorithm is mainly identified based on two factors, correctness and efficiency.
That means how correctly and how efficiently (i.e. how fast and using how much memory)
the algorithm solves the given problem. In computer science some algorithms are defined for common problems which we came across 
very frequently, like sorting, finding the shortest distance, etc.
